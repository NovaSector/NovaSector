// This file contains a WHOLE BUNCH of cost defuckulations to bring the ancient black market stuff back into line with our current cargo pricing.
// I've also taken the liberty of redoing a few descs because man they kinda suck.
// Some availability_probs have been upped considerably for items that I think should be core to the "dodgy" character archetype, like switchblades, science goggles and the various maintenance pills.
