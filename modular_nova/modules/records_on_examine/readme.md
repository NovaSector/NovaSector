## Title: Re-implements complete records functionality, my old records on examine PR, implements a exploitables menu.

MODULE ID: records_on_examine

### Description:

This PR allows med/sec huds to view medical/security records on examine, respectively, as well as allowing you to view general records. It
also allows certain antags to view exploitables on examine as well. It also fully restores what functionality records had prior to the pref rework. Basically,
my last 2 prs in one. It also refactors how record saves are handled, and how admin antag removals work.

### TG Proc/File Changes:

EDIT: examine.dm, human.dm, datacore.dm, flavor_text.dm, species_features.tx, tgui.dm, preferences_savefile.dm, antag_datum.dm, mind.dm. Allowed links to appear in chat when viewing people with huds/as certain antags, allows clikcing them to paste the records of the other party into chat. Re-implements the storing and handling of records into datacore, adds UI for that in flavor_text and species_features. Modified TGUI to recognize the exploitable manifest. Changed preferences_savefile.dm to comment out the way we used to save and load records, it's handled in flavor_text.dm now. Adds and removes the exploitables verb now, by changing mind.dm and antag_datum.dm.
