		Designed from the ground-up to be reliable, durable, and still relatively cheap for mass adoption, the Blokstaart series was developed around \
		the .40 Sagittarian cartridge, well before its official adoption as .40 Sol Long. \
		This close relationship between rifle and cartridge allows all conventional variants of the Blokstaart to share magazines and cartridges, \
		lengthening the lifespans of logistics coordinators, quartermasters, and other supply staff by several years.<br>\
		<br>\
		While primarily manufactured for military sale, limited amounts were sold to the civilian market when it was still in service. \
		When the MMR-2543 series was initially adopted, the Blokstaart series was decommissioned and left for surplus stockpiles - which gave it \
		a second life during the Rimward War, when those stockpiles were smuggled into occupied territories to arm a great deal of SolFed partisans.<br>\
		<br>\
		With the further adoption of the MMR-2543, Veldjen-Kuiper Armories has decided to open sales to independent customers \
		to make good use of their surplus stock."
