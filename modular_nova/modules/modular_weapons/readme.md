## Title: Modular Weapons

MODULE ID: MODULAR_WEAPONS

### Description:

The forbidden hell-hole of god's mistakes

### Important Note:
"Time To Down" notes:
- The following assumes no armor, no healing, and no wound immunity:
- rifles: 3-3.5s TTD
- pistols: 3.5-4s TTD
- snipers: 4s TTD
- boltactions/pumpactions/anything-you-can-fumble: use rifles

Keep wound chance for stuff doing over 20 damage on the lower-end, unless it's a gimmick for specifically wound chance
