## Title: Lorecasters

MODULE ID: LORECASTERS

### Description:

For broadcasting lore-related stories via newscasters and the archives app.
To add a story to rotation, add it to config/nova/news_stories.json, ideally at the top of the file for maximum organization
Once a story's been out too long, or there's too many in circulation, move older ones to config/nova/archived_stories.json, again ideally add it to the top (however these entries auto-sort by date in-game)
