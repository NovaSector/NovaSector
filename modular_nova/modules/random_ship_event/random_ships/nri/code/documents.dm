	<br><br><small>Annotation. The guide is devoted to the consideration of the legal foundations of the expeditionary patrol police of the Novaya Rossiyskaya Imperiya. The scientific analysis of the normative legal acts regulating the activities of the expeditionary patrol police allows us to establish its tasks and functions, as well as the main areas of activity. The system and methods of applying proactive self-defense in the activities of the expeditionary patrol police of the Novaya Rossiyskaya Imperiya are considered. The issues of its differences with the central and political police are touched upon. Attention is paid to the socio-practical significance of issues related to ensuring external security in the Novaya Rossiyskaya Imperiya in the fight against ordinary crime.</small>
	<br><br>One of the main functions of any sovereign State is to ensure national security, that is, to take measures to protect individuals, society and the state from internal and external threats. Through the implementation of this function, the territorial integrity and sustainable development of the state is ensured, its defense and security are strengthened, rights, freedoms, and a decent standard of living of the population are ensured.
	<br>The expeditionary police plays an important role in the protective function of the Novaya Rossiyskaya Imperiya in the second half of the XXVI century. It was it who, in addition to the protective functions, was entrusted with difficult tasks of general management. The main task of the expeditionary police was to ensure and protect the interests of the imperial government at the facilities defined by agreements on interaction and cooperation. At the same time, it was the expeditionary police that was obliged to assist the political police in ensuring the internal security of the Empire.
	<br>In order to effectively carry out the activities of the expeditionary police, an Instruction was adopted to the ranks of independently functioning departments, which consolidated the organizational structure, rights and duties of the ranks of the latter. In particular, the Instruction determined that the branches have the purpose of their activities to secretly investigate and conduct inquiries in the form of preventing, eliminating, exposing and prosecuting criminal acts of an ordinary nature; expanding, consolidating and promoting the influence of the state in the sector. The Instructions drew attention to the area of activity of a chosen dispatch, as well as to the fact that all information on cases of a political nature, the heads of dispatches are required to document those immediately. Of interest is also a note in the Instructions, according to which the chiefs of the expeditionary police were minimally subordinate to the supreme headquarters, and were on self-government.
	<br>The instruction defined the boundaries of self-defense of independent branches. In particular, clear factors were determined, consisting of obvious aggression or preparation for illegal actions on the part of the cooperating stations and the preparations necessary for their action were made. Everything, however, lies entirely on the highest rank designated by the patrol. In addition, the principles of signaling aggression were also defined. Signaling methods, code terminology, and so on will be discussed in the next part of the document set.
	<br><br>Per current NRI External Relationships, as well as NRI Internal Affairs Collegium regulations, the following procedure must be performed, to minimse the risk of first response patrol casualties, as well as better station-to-patrol communication chances:
	<br>1. Ensure that the station's bodyguarding dispatch is limited to one person per two heads only; with a maximum of three present if all heads are invited. This list includes Personal Protection Specialists, i.e. Blueshields, Redshields; security personnel; hired off-station mercenaries; weaponised crewmembers or other militia; weaponised animals, and so on;
	<br>2. Ensure that the station's bodyguarding dispatch is positioned right in front of you; with a clear escape route present to you and your colleagues. It is permitted to install additional reinforcements or barricades in order to increase your chances of survival against untrustworthy elements, if deemed necessary by your commanding officer;
	<br>3. Ensure that the station's command and security/military/defense force is not inspecting your ship, nor close approaching it, without your commanding officer's permission. It is recommended to leave a single officer as a ship's overseer, in order to minimise government property damage, as well as ensure maximum patrol efficiency in the field;
	<br>4. Ensure that the station's security/military/defense force is not preparing for a raid, using your shipped <small>(assembly required)</small> camera console. If needed, call them out on your ship's preinstalled station announcements system and remind them of invested funds, or the station's connections with the government, or so on;
	<br>5. Ensure that the ship, or any of the officers hasn't received any parcels, envelopes, letters or other packages, without its contents being stated by a third party and re-reviewed by any of the officers afterwards, to minimise chances of a bombing, teleportation, or any other terroristic act. If any of the above mentioned objects are to be received without the following procedured being initiated, it is required to dispose of the following objects immediately and report to the commanding officer.
	<br><br>From the recent observations, while not being defined pre-revision in the following list, and officialy not being disclosed by the Nanotrasen Corporation, you might become a victim to their recent invention: a high-precision high-velocity particle accelerator, the Bluespace Artillerty Cannon. This weaponry is frequency-locked on certain global positioning systems, which are according to state regulations are built into the ship's hull. Said weaponry is excellent at disposing of small fighters to patrol corvettes, and damaging attack frigates; capable of splitting your standard issue corvette in half. And thus, to minimise your casualties and to ensure your safety, this guide provides you with a necessary information on how to circumvent said weaponry.
	<br>In order to perform a dodging maneuver, you have to:
	<br>1. For the ship, lock onto the stable position in space, using your navigations console;
	<br>2. The moment Bluespace Artillery Cannon starts charging up, boot up the ship's thrusters;
	<br>3. And as such, dodge the Artillery shot. Its design is position-locked and is only good against stationary, or especially slow targets, thus, allowing you to move away from the target position.
	<br><b>In the case of a confirmed Bluespace Artillery fire on your position, any other unauthorised Bluespace Artillery fire during your presence on station, threats to use the Bluespace Artillery against the dispatch, or sector-wide Bluespace Artillery fire announcement, it is required to dispose of it, as it's a direct notification of aggression towards the dispatch and the foreign nation.</b>
	<br><br>Bluespace Artilleries are a fragile pieces of machinery, so a directed explosion over any of its main battery's parts will disable it for good. For that, you'll require a single standard-issue block of C4 composite explosive, as well as precise follow of this instructions:
	<br>In order to destroy a BSA cannon, you have to:
	<br>1. Approach the main battery, usually looking and designed like the huge artillery emplacement;
	<br>2. Set a C4 plastic explosive charge on it, preferably with a signaller attached for maximum efficiency, or an otherwise short explosion timer;
	<br>3. Depart the explosion radius and the artillery cannon itself, causing additional destruction and damage to other pieces of the artillery in the process. It is advised to do so, as that'll delay any possible attempts at rebuilding the artillery piece.
	<br><b>Afterwards, if any of the following procedures are to be enacted, the station is to be considered a hostile ground; and you are fully permitted to perform the preemptive self-defense procedures afterwards, without the commanding officer's approval.</b>
	<br><br>If any of the following conditions are not met, or in the case of a Bluespace Artillery fire, you're authorised to request the preemptive self-defense procedures initiation from your commanding officer; which, in turn, allows you to disable and arrest the station's security forces, using any of the equipment available to you, or otherwise acquired.
	<br><small>Thus, the creation of independent branches in the Empire led to the fact that these units directed the activities of the entire police to combat ordinary crimes. Prior to their formation, the task of combating corporal crime was the direct responsibility of the ranks of the local planetary patrols and, in special cases, the Planetary Guard. The ranks of independent departments were given equal rights in the investigation of criminal offenses with the ranks of the planetary police, since they acted on the basis of the same adopted normative legal acts. The provisions of the law created in accordance with the recent Instruction were more specifically defined: the goals, tasks of independent departments, their internal structure, the procedure for conducting operational investigative actions. At the same time, it, in general, has not changed the principle of organizational structure of patrols and therefore they, nevertheless, in part, remain limited in their activities within the territory under their jurisdiction. In this regard, they cannot carry out operational search activities outside the stations to which they were assigned.</small>

	default_raw_text = {"Hey, officer, we couldn't arrange getting you a proper military frigate, -you know, those goddamn bureaucrats with their permission requests and paperwork-, so the police corvette will have to suffice.
	<br> It was not designed for any kind of long-term deployments and anything more aggressive than standard patrol duty, so expect frequent power outages and a significant lack of specialized inspection equipment.
	<br> We have done some quick modifications to make it more suitable for police use, and acquired you some defensive and medical-grade equipment to balance it out. And some sidearms that were conveniently "decommissioned". It should do the job for now.
	<br> It is worth mentioning that your fourth officer, the maintenance crewman, went on leave. He's been under a lot of stress lately so it's only fair to let him get some well deserved rest - he has been maintaining this ship the whole time you've been in cryosleep. This should not affect your performance anyways.
	<br> As for the broken Krinkov, there is nothing we can do for now. Will have to use the standard-issue police sidearms, not like you're here to engage in combat anyways.
	<br> And, please, for the love of God and the Eternal Empress - do not make this inspection into a confrontation. We can't afford any diplomatic incidents in this sector, especially with most of our resources being tied up elsewhere.
	<br>
	<br> Don't screw this up,
