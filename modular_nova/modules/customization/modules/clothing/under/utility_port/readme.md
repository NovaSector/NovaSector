## Title: Utility Port

MODULE ID: utility_port

### Description:

Ports several outfits from citbase, with the highlight being Utility Uniforms: dark-grey jumpsuits with departmental markings, with the same stats as the department's default jumpsuit.
It also ports:
Other "utility" uniforms such as a gas/chemical hazard uniform;
Japanese and Victorian costumes;
Two short dresses;
Several departmental/head-of-staff berets;
All items are avaliable through either the Loadout, Vendors, or Both.

PART 2!
Ports the rest of what I was given with the utility uniforms, namely the Suits that go with all the previously added outfits. Also tweaks some of the previously added items (i.e., making the gas/chemical haz-uniform actually acidproof)
