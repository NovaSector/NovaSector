*	This file is for things that are recolorable and/or mix-and-match. Things like Jeans, T-Shirts, Skirts.
*	Basically the hope is that items here will reuse component icons that already exist in the .dmis where possible.
*
*	(Do not put items here that are too specific. These should generally be generic, customizable uniforms.)
*	These will likely fit in the CASUALWEAR loadout category.
