			but later declassified for normal research. Nobody knows where the original designs came from, and \
			how Nanotrasen got the designs, you'll probably never know.<br>\
			<br>\
			However, continuous improvements over the design allow it to fully utilize the anomalous energies \
			from a flux anomaly's core, leveraging the flux core's power to provide both \
			total protection against electromagnetic pulse interference, and keep a user's body upright even under stress \
			that would incapacitate or outright kill lesser men. There are some caveats with this, though.<br>\
			<br>\
			Without a flux core, the voltaic combat cyberheart only provides increased blood regeneration, \
			and with a flux core, receiving an electromagnetic pulse will force the heart into voltaic overdrive, \
			which could possibly leave the user vulnerable to a direct attack once their voltaic overdrive wears off. \
			Voltaic overdrive lasts about <b>thirty seconds</b>, and recharges after approximately <b>five minutes</b>. \
			In that four minutes and thirty seconds between, though, the user is quite vulnerable.", \
