  - bugfix: "Nanotrasen apologizes for issuing its Heads of Security faulty \"Volta\" stunswords that somehow turned invisible when their energy variant was turned on. Nanotrasen also would like to remind employees that the new stunswords are \"Volta\" stunswords and not \"NT-20 Excalibur\" variant stunswords; someone forgot to update the memo before initial rollouts occurred."
