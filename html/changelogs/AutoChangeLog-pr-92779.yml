  - rscdel: "Golems which somehow manage to grow wings and somehow manage to equip something that covers their jumpsuit can no longer fly. (Seriously, this will not affect anyone)"
  - refactor: "Refactored clothing obscurity entirely. Items should be a loooot more consistent and what covers what, and should update a lot snappier. As always, report any oddities, like mysteriously disappearing articles of clothing, hair, or species parts"
