  - rscadd: "Added greyscale Fedoras, available in the Clothesmate!"
  - image: "Resprited most of the Fedoras - now they'll all be much more consistent with the detective's updated and sleek ones. They also all have a hairmask now, so hair will no longer clip with them!"
  - image: "To pair with this, the Beige suit has been just slightly tweaked and the Curator's \"Treasure Hunter Jacket\" entirely recolored to better match their fedoras."
