changes:
  - rscadd: "Some bloodtypes now have unique behavior, such as liquid electricity blood glowing in the dark, podpeople \"water-blood\" not staining items or turfs, and oil not transferring viruses."
  - rscadd: "Non-blood blood now contains DNA, meaning that, for example, Ethereal blood works just fine for making a vaccine in a PANDEMIC machine."
  - rscadd: "Cyborgs and bots can now leave bloody (or oily) tracks if their wheels get stained."
  - balance: "Slimepeople are now capable of bleeding (slime jelly), be careful with knives!"
  - balance: "Oil blood now requires welding fuel to be restored, slime jelly can be restored with stable plasma and snail lube with silicon (previously all 3 were affected by iron). Saline solution no longer works on non-iron-based blood."
  - bugfix: "Mindless monkeys and big manipulators should be able to harvest replica pods now."
  - bugfix: "Reagents that went inside of a mob no longer lose some of their properties when sucked back out."
  - bugfix: "Burdened chaplain's blessing now properly plays its SFX and grants a moodlet when successful, instead of doing so upon failure."
  - code_imp: "Optimized human rendering slightly."
  - refactor: "Species reagent interactions now are fully handled by their livers."
  - refactor: "Refactored all blood decals and a lot of mob blood handling code, report if anything is broken!"
