  - balance: "Caged mechs cannot accept silicon pilots. AI uploaded pilots, AI control beacons, MMIs or positronics. Malfunctioning AIs can still dominate these mechs."
  - code_imp: "Allows for a higher degree of granularity for what mechs can and cannot accept by including additoinal mecha flags to block beacon type installations, pilot uploads and so on."
