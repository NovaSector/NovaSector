  - balance: Security MODsuit plate designs are back under Security Modular Suits.
  - code_imp: Reduced redundant code between the Kolben combat shotgun and Laevateinn

      stuff to a component. If bugs crop up relating to either of those two, please
      report it.
  - rscadd: Adds the KOLBEN/NACHTREIHER shotgun parts kit to Cargo's goodies tab at

      of surplus Jaeger/MOD "Infantry" suits to their security teams' heavy equipment
      lockers, and off-loading spares into expeditionary surplus crates. Caveat emptor.

  annikaRU:

      the sprites'
  carpotoxin:
  - bugfix: Drifting contractor event no longer requires 2 candidates to succeed spawning
  vinylspiders:

  - rscadd: Added an amputation function to the bonesaw when targeting limbs, and
      changed the item description to hint towards that.
  Stalkeros for the code, splet for the sprites:
  - rscadd: Combat-oriented NIFsofts have started to circulate among some more unsavory
      elements. Blood is fuel, and all that.
  - image: Kills the immersive upper message to say that NIFsoft disks have been respited.
  carpotoxin:

  - rscadd: Reintroduced the combat shotgun crate (2500cr for 3 shotguns and 3 bandoliers)
      and combat shotgun goody pack (1000cr for 1 shotgun and 1 bandolier). Prospective
      users are advised that, although it does have a hefty damage multiplier, the
      combat shotgun itself is also terribly hefty, and cannot be stowed anywhere
      but on the back.
  - balance: Nachtreiher combat shotguns have lost their semi-auto functionality,
      lost a shell's worth of magazine tube capacity, and have had their barrel chargers
      downtuned in order to mitigate a recent string of catastrophic failures from
      material strain.
  - qol: Expeditionary Corps armor vests and modular infantry MODsuits can now equip
      machete scabbards to their suit storage.
  - image: Repaired pointman shields now have a unique on-mob/worn sprite.

      one, i assure you) is now reverted back to its grey color. To avoid confusion,
      of course, not because it was *stronger*
