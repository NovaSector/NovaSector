  - rscadd: Paradox Clones are now tasked to `Be the only [x] alive`, meaning means
      of identity cloning (such as Genetics or Changelings) may throw a wrench in
      your plan.
  Melbert, Toriate:

      charge, compared to a t1 recharger that takes 20 seconds to a full charge.
  - balance: SC1, SC2 and the Hellgun were approved for civilian use in the frontier,
      so they no longer require permit for concealed carry.
  - admin: Removed the Admin GPS from the debug tool box. Its still spawnable if needed,
      but it should make admin intervention less overtly.
  - qol: In compliance with SolFed safety regulations, we have disabled the overdrive
      from our escape shuttles, forcing us to replace the hyperdrives with TX2 models.
      These are roughly 30% faster to prepare, but safety meassures cannot be skipped
      from the startup, this means shuttles will take 12 minutes from 17 minutes to
      prepare, and will arrive 3 minutes after preparation, setting the time for our
      shuttles to arrive from CC to the station from 20 to 15 minutes, in all alert

  - spellcheck: Replaced ooc ic in RCD, RPLD, and alien power feedback

  intense-skies:
  - rscadd: Added new quirk 'Abnormal Body Temperature' for added uniqueness.

2025-09-24:
  OrbisAnima:

      the fishing pools, automation only gets you the baseliine stuff. Fish for the
      actual rewards!

      for CODEX to get around its firmware, really.
  - balance: Monocloning jumpercables breed themselves into the Sterile Jumpercables,
      to no one's surprise! (They no longer mate and cannot self reproduce as they
      did in the past, they are still pretty great, just not an AFK exponential swarm
      of free power and money.)
2025-09-26:
  Aliceee2ch:

  - bugfix: Borg inducer can charge again

      as a changeling.
  Hatterhat:
  - qol: Adjusted the proto-kinetic melee variant descriptions to not be so long and

      on standard detonation (up from 10), and 120 damage (down from 200) on backstab.
  Melbert:
  - qol: Reworked stammering. Only the first character is stammered, and digraphs

  OrbisAnima:
  - qol: Bluespace Miners and Powerators are now available on the engineering cargo
      console request, allowing engineering to help cargo with effort of their own.
  - balance: Civilian Power generators adjusted. The RTG now produces a 1 tile radiation
      with half chance, with their power being 12KW from 15KW. The Atomic Whisper
      was toned down in efficiency, its now thrice as much as the super pacman (formely
      six as much), produces twice the power of a pacman (so 20KW instead of 32KW
      per increment), and produces water vapor and helium at a 9 to 1 rate, at 400C,
      from room temperature helium at 5. Byproducts can still be sold of course, but
      it requires effort, that said, the atomic whisper does not produce radiation.
      Reduced their material cost a bit to reflect their nerf.
  - balance: Powerators were nerfed and made engineering only. Values for their consumption
      were adjusted all over,  with each company having different maximuns of production,
      powerator efficiency, and taxes. With NT and Tarkon having high taxes and high
      energy rates but having a higher cap of power selling, while the syndicate and
      then dyne paying less taxes or needing less power, at the cost of capping how
      much they can sell, making it so the more effort involved the more credits per
      hour achievable. Details on the PR, but the powerators will give their stats
      on examine.
  - bugfix: Fixed some powerator issues, notably their power not matching to what
      they were set and consuming, made them very customizable with VV and more intuitive
      to use by mappers and admins, players will also find their stats when examining
      instead of having to code dive for this information.
  - qol: Powerator now automatically goes down to the power it has available instead
      of not processing. We are aware this could be a negative if the power is not
      constant, you might want to setup smes units in the middle.
  - rscadd: The portable Gravity Generator, as well as minor tools packs, were made
      accesible by the public at large, instead of just restricted to Engineering.
  - code_imp: Cleaned up the code for Powerators and made it single accounts, as the
      need for two accounts was removed. Can be reverted in the future with ease,
      but for now we save a couple process pass. Updated the Powerator to use proper
      TG procs to make it a lil bit more robust against the passage of time.
  OrionTheFox:
  - rscadd: The Turtleneck Sweater (Now "Cableknit Sweater") is now reskinnable! The
      Keyhole and Cleavage sweaters have been merged into it, plus an additional new

      effects at arm health thresholds.
  - code_imp: Cleans up some of the mutation code.
  - balance: Being frail or being more resistant to wounding is now more consistent
      about how it hinders or benefits you.

  Ezel.:
  - map: Reduces the amount of general available Sec clothes vendors across all maps
  Gboster-0:
  - bugfix: shuttle engines no longer provide negative power to your shuttles if you
      unwrench them.
  Ghommie:
  - balance: Some sturdy objects that you cannot just grab drag around, like mechs,
      are more resilient against being thrown around by weaker explosions.
  - bugfix: Some things, like bolted AIs, aren't thrown around by explosions at all.
  - balance: airlocks affected by dimensional anomalies retain their access, as well
      as access-adjacent attributes such as emergency access and unrestricted sides.
  Hatterhat:
  - balance: Pestkiller now damages spider structures (e.g. webs, effigies, eggs)
      upon exposure (e.g. spraying, smoke, foam).
  - balance: Webslinger snares now do less damage and are easier to resist out of
      (it still takes 10 seconds though, which is non-negligible).
  - balance: Spider effigies (the ones that look like Eris sprites) now check for
      ear protection when trying to inflict brain damage. Bowmans are sufficient to
      block the trauma infliction, at time of writing.
  Kashargul:
  - bugfix: keycombo modal only allowing an input on the first opening
  Krysonism:
  - rscadd: Added poker chips.

      metals.

      roll.
  Melbert:
  - balance: Reinforced floors will stop light and heavy explosions from affecting
      objects beneath the floor, ie cabling and piping
  - balance: Explosions affecting floors are no longer blocked by *any structure*,
      such as posters. Only dense structures block them.
  - balance: Machines can now block explosions from affecting floors, much like structures
  - refactor: Reagent containers like cups, beakers, bottles, syringes, droppers,
      condiments packs, and iv bags have been refactored. Report any oddities, particularly

      removed
