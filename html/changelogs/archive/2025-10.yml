      Yes, this includes converting them as a headrev / blood bro

      as they are both RR weapons capable of completly derailing a round. Removes
      the part from the station to not confuse players, but leaves it on ds2 as its

      Boxing on lizardpeople. Or crabpeople when they are added in 2030.
  - bugfix: The warp sfx now works properly.
  - bugfix: The Jaws of Recovery bonesetting mode now has an actual sprite.
  - bugfix: Some Jaws of Recovery cabinets that were strangely empty are now filled.
  - rscadd: Adds the Jaws of Recovery. One can be found in a locked glass cabinet
      in medical. These jaws of life are restricted on what they can force open, and
      alert security and medical whenever they are utilized to pry open departmental
      doors. They can't be used to open high security doors whatsoever. And they come
      with a bonesetter attachment instead of wirecutters. You know, for power-relocating
      your arm.
  - qol: The chaplain energy swords now work like energy swords. Turn them on and
      off! Light your way with the blade. Light a cigarette with your blade like a
