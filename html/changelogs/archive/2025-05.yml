      again or not.
  OrbisAnima:
  - balance: Forged Armor was improved all around, made more significant and less
      grindy to upgrade (6 pieces for a full set vs 12).  While it no longer reachs
      Drake Armor levels of Melee protection, its other stats make it more formidable
      and useful for the day to day.
  - rscadd: Chainshirt added to the forging workbench, as an alternative for the Plate
      mail, less focused on melee and bullets, more on energy types. Not to be confused
      with the Heartkin Chainshirt, which has the same stats as the platemail.
  - rscdel: Removed the melee telegraphs we had overriding mobs, now we use 100% the
      TG AI based attack delays, which are more efficient.
  - balance: Makes all Virology viruses get a health indicator when they regen, with
      a notable exception of the stealth version of Regenerative Coma, for obvious
      reasons.
  - balance: Makes Hemopages regen get a health indicator when they regen.
  - balance: Makes Slime People regen get a health indicator when they regen.
  - balance: Makes Pod People / Plant Persons regen get a health indicator when they
      regen., and show an annoyed one when dying from being starved.
  - balance: Armor is no longer restricted on Cargo Imports. Vokshod Modsuit kit is
      still restricted, but not the depowered version.
  - qol: Bridge Assistants and hobbyist can now be more discrete when cleaning carpet
      and polishing furniture, as tables are now  43% percent bigger, thus allowing
      people to 'Army Crawl' under them. (New verb adquired on IC, Army Crawl, lets
      you hide under things if you are resting, you cannot do anything other than
      use emotes and move, credits to Odairu from Bubber for making the original code)
  RealWinterFrost:

      objects on them.

  Iajret:
  - balance: Recent advancements made getting SAD blueprint a much easier affair,
      requiring only a tiny fraction of CPU time from proprietary research neural
      networks than it did before. SAD now comes as a part of advanced medical tech
      (tm) node.

      the Nova-specific nodes (or close to all)
  jlsnow301, aylong:

  - rscadd: Xenoarcheologist noted the presence of dormant ancient tech fragment covered
      in what looks like native's runes in the icemoon's strange rocks. Some of these
      runes seems broken, maybe the natives can engrave them anew. They might even
      have a use for these.
  - rscadd: Added a Runic Greataxe, wich is a reskinned kinetic crusher.
  - rscadd: Added a Runic Spear, wich is a reskinned spear kinetic crusher.

  Hatterhat:
  - balance: Due to lobbying by defense and import companies, ammunition workbenches
      now work on a more granular licensing system, dictating what ammo they can or
      cannot print based on what authentication modules are installed.
  - spellcheck: A lot of ammo types are back to more conventional names and not made-up
      cartridges. Probably.
  - qol: The ammunition workbench UI is no longer Green.
  Neocloudy:
  - refactor: ExaminePanel has been refactored to use TypeScript JSX instead of JavaScript
      JSX

      OOC notes, instead of the normal fields! These require clicking a tab in the
      examine panel to see.
  - qol: Specific ERP preferences are hidden in the NSFW OOC notes tab.
