2025-05-01:
  A.C.M.O.:

      protolathes.
  - rscadd: Added empty medipens to medical lathe for Epinephrine, Atropine, Oxandrolone,
      Salicylic Acid, Salbutamol, and Pentetic Acid.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused the Medipen Refiller to only refill up to 10u.
  OrionTheFox:
  - rscadd: Chaps are now Greyscale, and can now also be used as an accessory! Ctrl-Shift-Click
      to switch between Accessory and Uniform!
  TimErmolt:

      the eye color selected in character setup.
2025-05-02:
  A.C.M.O.:
  - rscadd: Silicon Headshot character preference, to pick a unique AI/Cyborg headshot
      image.
  - qol: Changed the value of the Voice Actor quirk to 0, making it a neutral quirk.
  FearfulFurnishing:
  - qol: Ashwalker examine text now shows the observer if they are ready to evolve
      again or not.
  OrbisAnima:
  - balance: Forged Armor was improved all around, made more significant and less
      grindy to upgrade (6 pieces for a full set vs 12).  While it no longer reachs
      Drake Armor levels of Melee protection, its other stats make it more formidable
      and useful for the day to day.
  - rscadd: Chainshirt added to the forging workbench, as an alternative for the Plate
      mail, less focused on melee and bullets, more on energy types. Not to be confused
      with the Heartkin Chainshirt, which has the same stats as the platemail.
  - rscdel: Removed the melee telegraphs we had overriding mobs, now we use 100% the
      TG AI based attack delays, which are more efficient.
  - balance: Makes all Virology viruses get a health indicator when they regen, with
      a notable exception of the stealth version of Regenerative Coma, for obvious
      reasons.
  - balance: Makes Hemopages regen get a health indicator when they regen.
  - balance: Makes Slime People regen get a health indicator when they regen.
  - balance: Makes Pod People / Plant Persons regen get a health indicator when they
      regen., and show an annoyed one when dying from being starved.
  - balance: Armor is no longer restricted on Cargo Imports. Vokshod Modsuit kit is
      still restricted, but not the depowered version.
  - qol: Bridge Assistants and hobbyist can now be more discrete when cleaning carpet
      and polishing furniture, as tables are now  43% percent bigger, thus allowing
      people to 'Army Crawl' under them. (New verb adquired on IC, Army Crawl, lets
      you hide under things if you are resting, you cannot do anything other than
      use emotes and move, credits to Odairu from Bubber for making the original code)
  RealWinterFrost:
  - bugfix: Fixed the syndiepads to function and properly "calculate" value of of
      objects on them.
