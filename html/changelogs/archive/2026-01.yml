  - rscadd: You can now also load stunprods into ballistas, make sure you turn them

      now dependent on what kind of spear is loaded into it, and is generally a bit
      lower
  - balance: Mounted guns are less accurate when not wrenched down
  - bugfix: Cancelling reloading a ballista now cancels the reload rather than completing
      it.
  - bugfix: You can pick up the exact same spear you fired out of a ballista, rather
      than a totally new generic spear
  - bugfix: It is possible to damage and destroy mounted guns with weapons

  - balance: Heretic items which apply rust (grenades and eldritch reagent) check
      the rust resistance level of the turf rather than always rusting it.

      tool, it redirects the click to the patient instead of placing the tool on the
      table
  - rscadd: Surgery has been REWORKED ENTIRELY
  - rscadd: Surgery is now STATE BASED. What does this mean? Well, when you start
      surgery, you apply drapes and then make an incision. Then you can either retract
      skin or clamp bleeders. Once you retract skin you gain access to outer cavity
      operations, then once you saw the bones, inner cavity operations.
  - balance: If your vessels are unclamped, you bleed pretty fast. Clamp those blood
      vessels fast to stop blood loss in surgery.
  - balance: Species which lack skin or bones allow you to skip surgical steps. Skeletons
      have no skin to incise, after all.

      only chemicals in the patient.

      dead.
  - rscadd: Organ fishing can now be complete in someone with an open cavity, rather
      than someone undergoing organ manipulation.
  - balance: You can no longer fish a vital organ (the brain) out of someone.
  - rscadd: Organ thrower mod now works on people with open cavities, rather than
      people undergoing organ manipulation.
  - rscadd: Chestbursters now no longer gib people with open cavities, rather than
      people undergoing organ manipulation.
  - rscadd: Xenomorphs now have CHITIN rather than FLESH. This means little besides
      indicating you need a saw to incise their skin.
  - rscadd: Sterilizine and similar chemicals now have a set duration, 1 minute per
      unit applied, up to 5 minutes.
  - rscadd: Medibot upgrades are now applied automatically on research. Syncing is
      dead.

      cyborgs, please report it

      limbs

      longer have a 0.9 modifier to tox / oxy damage.
  - balance: Golems have a new 0.6x modifier to stamina damage and stun duration,
      but also a new 1.2x modifier to knockdown duration.
  - balance: Golems can no longer be defibrillated. Revival surgery is... untouched,
      I guess.
  - balance: Golems can be revived by applying materials to their body. Each sheet
      restores some brute and burn damage, as well as some nutrition. When sufficient
      brute, burn, and nutrition are restored, they are revived!
  - balance: Golems can no longer fall into soft crit. They can still enter hard crit
      and die when taking sufficient damage, though.
  - balance: When a golem is attacked with brute or burn damage, they sustain direct
      nutrition drain based on how much damage dealt.
  - balance: Golems drain nutrition faster if near starving or below the normal soft
      crit threshold.
  - balance: Golems fall unconscious if starving.
  - balance: When a golem's nutrition hits 0, they die!
  - balance: Golems cannot get overweight, but are capped on the amount of nutrition
      they can have
  - balance: The strength of titanium's reduction to brute damage when consumed by
      a golem or rock eater has been reduced (0.7x -> 0.8x)

  - balance: Golems now have a unique bodytype, making them ineligible for some surgeries
  - rscadd: Adds "reset dislocation" operation, which is a surgical analog to resetting
      a dislocated limb. Same tools, same steps, but if you go through the effort
      of doing it surgically, it's faster and safer.
  - rscadd: All wound surgeries now gain a speed bonus from being wound scanned.
  - balance: Plasmamen no longer take flat 1.5x brute and burn damage
  - balance: Plasmamen are now affected by weapon demolition modifier, meaning blunt
      attacks deal more damage but slashing or piercing deal less damage
  - balance: Skeletons and Golems are also affected by weapon demolition modifier,
      as well as any mineral type mobs (of which none currently exist)
  - bugfix: Fixes more surgeries being marked as a priority operation that intended
  - bugfix: Naive and Desensitized people get less sad at death
  - rscadd: Adds "surgical processor implant", a cybernetic brain implant which grants
      the user knowledge of whatever surgeries are installed in it.
  - bugfix: Moth wing repair surgery correctly checks that bones are intact rather
      than bones are sawed
  - rscadd: You can skip the "apply drapes" step of surgery if the patient is buckled
      to an operating table or stasis bed!
  - balance: Pressure damage scales over time. It starts at 2 per second (pre-buff
      value) but increases by 0.5 damage every 1.2 minutes you are exposed, up to
      5 per second (requiring 7.2 full minutes of exposure).
  - rscadd: Adds stasis bodybags, unlocked with cryo tech. They put its occupants
      (organ or mobs) in stasis, but wear down over time.

      is"
  - qol: Biogenerators protect food placed on top of them from germs
  - rscadd: You can now find the SDMS-35 in Medbay, the CMO's office, the Psychologist's
      office, and possibly the Library. Quite simply, it's a reference book for all
      the brain trauma's you may experience.
  - bugfix: Syncing instruments no longer fails if starting instrument is held
  - spellcheck: Corrects the blind message for manual cauterization
  - bugfix: Fixed spotlight effect on multi-z map
  - bugfix: Surgical state applied by wounds no longer persist after fix

  - balance: 'Thermal vision mutation: Active duration 10s -> 30s  (with power, 30s->45s)'
  - balance: 'Thermal vision mutation: Cooldown 25s -> 60s (with energy, 60s -> 30s)'
  - balance: 'Thermal vision mutation: Eye damage 10 -> 7.5 (with sync, 7.5 -> 3.75)'
  - balance: 'Thermal vision mutation: Eye damage is now affected by power chromosome
      (with power, 7.5 -> 11.25)'
  - balance: Rebalanced Unstable Mutagen's / Uranium's botany use. It now always increases
      instability (on par with L4Z), and occasionally increases instability even more
      at the costs of some toxins. It also scales with volume
  - rscadd: Adds "Toxin Resistance" gene to botany which makes the plant immune to
      toxin damage. Given (and graftable from) Death Berries.
  - rscadd: Adds "Toxin Adaptation" gene to botany which makes the plant heal from
      toxin damage. Only in strange seeds (for now).
  - code_imp: Cleaned up a smidge of botany code
  - rscadd: All radios (intercoms and station-bounced) can have encryption keys installed
      in them, rather than solely headsets and cyborgs.
  - rscadd: Existing screwdriver interactions for station-bounced radios and intercoms
      have been moved to right click. However, intercoms will still default to the
      old behavior if they have no key installed.
  - qol: Screentips for radios.
  - rscdel: N-spect scanners can no longer print reports. All it does now is scan
      for contraband.

  - rscdel: Security no longer get bounties to loot the brig's equipment. Though the
      contraband bounty is still available.

      you to walk around an area for a bit. No scanning necessary.
  - refactor: Adds setters for bounties and bank accounts. Report any situations where
      your bank account is not set correctly.
  - refactor: ID trims now handle bounty generation. Report any situations where you
      get a weird pool of bounties.

      as fast.

      This means their timings and such may be a bit more unpredictable than what
      you''re used to. The difficulty should be about the same, but do approach with
      caution lest you get devoured...'
  - balance: Helping out (or just watching) the murderization of xenomorphs will give
      you a positive moodlet, with increased effect depending on the strength of the
      xenomorph. Bonus points for sending them out in gibby/dusty fashion.
