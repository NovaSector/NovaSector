  - spellcheck: Plant produce spawner now correctly spawns plum instead of plum seeds.
  - bugfix: Fixes for MetaStation fire alarms.
  - map: Removed one pair of firelocks in Brig cycling room - now it has fire sanity
      marker instead. That should prevent trapping anyone without crowbar inside.

  Gboster-0:
  - balance: wabbajack robot transformations are now weighted like 3 years ago
  Ghommie:
  - refactor: Follow-up to the crafting/material refactor from months ago. All objects
      crafted with stacks now inherit their mat composition (not necessarily the effects
      and color) by default, while previously only a few things like chair, sinks
      and toilets did. Report any object looking or behaving weirdly as a result.
  - bugfix: The material composition of ammo boxes is no longer a 1/10 of what it's
      supposed to be. It was a shitty hack to make it harder to recycle empty ammo
      boxes. Instead, they lose materials as they're emptied now.
  - refactor: Refactored inventory code a little to be hopefully more robust. Report
      any possible new, quirky nit or outright problematic issue with it.
  - bugfix: Storing objects with slowdown in a backpack or belt (or any such storage)
      now properly updates your speed.

      and regal overcoat from the clothesmate

      autodrobe, although you'll have to hack it for the latter.
  Hatterhat:
  - bugfix: Non-virtual megafauna should no longer be dropping encrypted caches when
      mulched with a crusher if their matching virtual domain was deployed.
  - bugfix: Virtual megafauna no longer count as valid kills for achievement tracking.

      mode (sucking nitrous by default) (related only to Nova maps)

      only to Nova maps)
  Jacquerel:
  - balance: The Captain's MODSuit pathfinder module now flies it directly to their
      location rather than physically traversing the halls of the station.
  LT3:
  - qol: Silent jaws of recovery is now less obvious that it's modified
  Melbert:
  - bugfix: Fix Flypeople's vomit interaction before anyone realizes it's broken but
      me
  - rscadd: Compact defib can be worn and used on the suit storage slot of labcoats,
      surgical aprons, and medical MODsuits
  - rscadd: Drones and Dex Holoparasites can (hypothetically) wear and use compact
      defibs
  - balance: Tech storage access is no longer a "command level" access, meaning the
      HoP can give it to crewmembers that have a normal ID card. Note, secure tech
      storage still requires bridge access, which requires a silver ID card.
  - qol: Stairs now have an indicator that stepping beyond them will take you upwards.
      You can disable it in accessibility settings if desired.
  - image: Stairs blend in and together better.
  - qol: If you are within a disposal bin or chute, and drop an item, the item will
      go into the bin, rather than onto the floor outside of the bin.

  - bugfix: '[Catwalk] Xenobio kill room uses a passive vent'
  - bugfix: '[Catwalk] Fixes a few erroneous space tiles around sec'
  - bugfix: Bolas don't slow while in hand
  - balance: Ammo will no longer show up in the Spy loot pool until a weapon that
      uses said ammo has been claimed. Some ammo for weapons easily obtainable on
      station (shotgun shot) are not limited by this restriction. Also, there's a
      rare chance ammo will show up anyways just to keep people on their toes.
  - balance: Claiming a weapon will refresh ammo in the loot pool that has already
      been claimed or cycled out.
  - balance: Bounty rewards that no Spy claimed have a chance to re-enter the loot
      pool after a bounty refresh, rather than being lost for the remainder of the
      round.
  - balance: When higher tier Spy bounties empty their loot pools, they will attempt
      to draw from lower tier pools before defaulting to telecrystals.
  - balance: Spies no longer are rewarded with gun cases for bounties; rather just
      the gun itself
  - spellcheck: Modified the Spy antag info text
  OrbisAnima:
  - balance: Removes Mining ID's and Mining Headset Keys from the Conscript Kit. Makes
      the kit requires no access so you can be a yanky miner as you always dreamed!
      Replaces the Explorer suit with a Seva suit, better fitted for civilians trying
      to be a miner than real monster hunter miners.
  - rscadd: Added a Mining Access kit, available only to NT cargo orders, which requires
      QM access as the mining kit once did. It includes a mining ID and mining headset
      keys.
  RealWinterFrost:
  - rscadd: Gives the roboticist a medsci headset.
  RikuTheKiller:
  - balance: R&D console boards sourced from printing or tech storage are now locked
      by default. It's recommended to ask your respective head of department or the
      science department to complete research for you. Heads of department can remotely
      access the research network using their PDAs.

      resorting to minimal amounts of deluxe being available roundstart
  - bugfix: Snowglobe's mystery signpost has been replaced by an actual signpost
  - qol: Voidraptor finally kicked out the syndies! But spiders moved in...
  - code_imp: Serenity's deer population has gone extinct, scientists are investigating
      their disappearance
  alien3301:
  - balance: The lethal injection locker is now accessible by the warden.
  ezel:
  - rscadd: Compact Defibrillator is now a Spy objective

      cargo if needed)

  - balance: Mech melee attacks can be blocked or avoided by a few rare sources.
  - bugfix: Sleeping carp now actually lets you dodge melee attacks without filling
      your hands with stuff.
  san7890:
  - balance: After noticing it was too easy for animals to crawl through maintenance
      by abusing the Easy-Exit sensors, Nanotrasen has replaced all unrestricted door
      sensors (like in maintenance) with a pull-down lever that should take around
      2-3 seconds to engage. It has been designed to allow the employee to actuate
      it despite any pressure differentials within an area.
  - balance: The above change does not apply to select doors in the medical section
      of the station, which will continue to use the "older" Ready-Exit system.
  - sound: In order to ensure that staff in high-traffic areas don't go bonkers due
      to this new change, sound dampeners have been installed to prevent the hydraulics
      from being heard for super long distances. However, they skimped out on the
      quality for the ones in maintenance...
  tontyGH:
  - refactor: Handling relating to AI cores has been overhauled. Please make an issue
      report on the Github if unexpected behaviour occurs.

      give an usage hint.
