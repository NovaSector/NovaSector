  Gboster-0:
  - balance: wabbajack robot transformations are now weighted like 3 years ago
  Ghommie:
  - refactor: Follow-up to the crafting/material refactor from months ago. All objects
      crafted with stacks now inherit their mat composition (not necessarily the effects
      and color) by default, while previously only a few things like chair, sinks
      and toilets did. Report any object looking or behaving weirdly as a result.
  - bugfix: The material composition of ammo boxes is no longer a 1/10 of what it's
      supposed to be. It was a shitty hack to make it harder to recycle empty ammo
      boxes. Instead, they lose materials as they're emptied now.
  - refactor: Refactored inventory code a little to be hopefully more robust. Report
      any possible new, quirky nit or outright problematic issue with it.

  Melbert:

      me

      surgical aprons, and medical MODsuits
  - rscadd: Drones and Dex Holoparasites can (hypothetically) wear and use compact
      defibs
  - balance: Tech storage access is no longer a "command level" access, meaning the
      HoP can give it to crewmembers that have a normal ID card. Note, secure tech
      storage still requires bridge access, which requires a silver ID card.
  - qol: Stairs now have an indicator that stepping beyond them will take you upwards.
      You can disable it in accessibility settings if desired.
  - image: Stairs blend in and together better.

  - bugfix: Bolas don't slow while in hand
  - balance: Ammo will no longer show up in the Spy loot pool until a weapon that
      uses said ammo has been claimed. Some ammo for weapons easily obtainable on
      station (shotgun shot) are not limited by this restriction. Also, there's a
      rare chance ammo will show up anyways just to keep people on their toes.
  - balance: Claiming a weapon will refresh ammo in the loot pool that has already
      been claimed or cycled out.
  - balance: Bounty rewards that no Spy claimed have a chance to re-enter the loot
      pool after a bounty refresh, rather than being lost for the remainder of the
      round.
  - balance: When higher tier Spy bounties empty their loot pools, they will attempt
      to draw from lower tier pools before defaulting to telecrystals.

      the gun itself
  - spellcheck: Modified the Spy antag info text
  OrbisAnima:
  - balance: Removes Mining ID's and Mining Headset Keys from the Conscript Kit. Makes
      the kit requires no access so you can be a yanky miner as you always dreamed!
      Replaces the Explorer suit with a Seva suit, better fitted for civilians trying
      to be a miner than real monster hunter miners.
  - rscadd: Added a Mining Access kit, available only to NT cargo orders, which requires
      QM access as the mining kit once did. It includes a mining ID and mining headset
      keys.
  RealWinterFrost:
  - rscadd: Gives the roboticist a medsci headset.
  RikuTheKiller:
  - balance: R&D console boards sourced from printing or tech storage are now locked
      by default. It's recommended to ask your respective head of department or the

  - qol: Voidraptor finally kicked out the syndies! But spiders moved in...

  - bugfix: Sleeping carp now actually lets you dodge melee attacks without filling
      your hands with stuff.
  san7890:
  - balance: After noticing it was too easy for animals to crawl through maintenance
      by abusing the Easy-Exit sensors, Nanotrasen has replaced all unrestricted door
      sensors (like in maintenance) with a pull-down lever that should take around
      2-3 seconds to engage. It has been designed to allow the employee to actuate
      it despite any pressure differentials within an area.
  - balance: The above change does not apply to select doors in the medical section
      of the station, which will continue to use the "older" Ready-Exit system.
  - sound: In order to ensure that staff in high-traffic areas don't go bonkers due
      to this new change, sound dampeners have been installed to prevent the hydraulics
      from being heard for super long distances. However, they skimped out on the
      quality for the ones in maintenance...
  tontyGH:
  - refactor: Handling relating to AI cores has been overhauled. Please make an issue
      report on the Github if unexpected behaviour occurs.

      the recent design documentation.
