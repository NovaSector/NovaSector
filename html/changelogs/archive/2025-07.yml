  Hatterhat:
  - bugfix: Nanotrasen apologizes for issuing its Heads of Security faulty "Volta"
      stunswords that somehow turned invisible when their energy variant was turned
      on. Nanotrasen also would like to remind employees that the new stunswords are

      to update the memo before initial rollouts occurred.
  - rscadd: Central Command, in tandem with the Free Trade Union, has discovered a

  Hatterhat:
  - rscadd: Citing the reason "Why not" and/or "because we can", Scarborough Arms
      has started to export the DURANDAL 23-E parts/conversion kit, for cannibalizing
      an NT20 into the rC-20 submachine gun. For obvious reasons, this is very much
      against corporate regs, as to do so would imply one would have robbed and/or
      murdered the local Shield unit.
  - rscadd: With the rumors of Scarborough Arms releasing parts kits that require
      cannibalizing NT20s to complete a new gun, Nanotrasen has chosen to release
      spare parts kits for NT20s in the slim chance that a Shield unit has their service
      weapon cannibalized for nefarious deeds.

  - balance: New specs for .38 ammunition allows for more propellant to be loaded,
      increasing damage dealt for most ammunition types.
