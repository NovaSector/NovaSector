  yooriss:
  - balance: The Night Vision quirk is now slightly stronger by default, allows you
      to choose a colour determine the hue of the darkness overlay, and becomes 75%
      more potent for each level of eye sensitivity you have. Individuals with hypersensitive
      eyes can see almost as well in the dark as Ashwalkers and Icecats can!
  - rscadd: The Photophobia quirk can now have its severity chosen as a character
      preference option, allowing any character to gain hypersensitive eyes if they're
      willing to deal with the consequences.
  - rscadd: The Cybernetic Limb Mounts quirk is now available, allowing organic characters
      with robotic limbs to freely remove them and reattach other robotic limbs at
      will if the limb in question isn't wounded. Humanoid synthetics can take the
      quirk to allow themselves to remove their own limbs without the need for exterior
      coaxing.
