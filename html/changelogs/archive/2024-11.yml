  Stalkeros, Majkl-J for the original PR:

  - bugfix: Ghosts can no longer disarm window airbags.
  - bugfix: The photocopier in Interdyne on icemoon is now free.
  - bugfix: The bone fragments shot out by dying horrorform changelings have the correct
      embed chance. Same with the expedition tomahawk.

  - code_imp: Replaced all their desc's with stuff that better fits the station, and
      removes mention of non-cannon conflicts and military behavior.

      equal to the solfed variants, instead of a flat downgrade.
  - balance: Changeling has gone from 15 > 10 genetic points, had strained muscles
      heavily cutdown in the speedboost, and finally had it's chem-regen cut in half.
