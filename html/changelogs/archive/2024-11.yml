      clip through hairstyles, headwear, etc less often!

  - rscadd: Adds a new multitool, the 'full override control kit', which aside from
      working as a regular multitool, allows the user to hack open or unlock APC's
      and Air Alarms. They do so rather aggresively, so it can break them with enough
      uses. They can be obtained from the premium section of YouTool or from broad
      band enabled AKH Frontier Imports.
  - qol: YouTool vendors premium section now holds the F.O.C.K., as well as a small
      selection of AKH frontier hand held devices. It is said that some vendors are
      being used to smuggle Prybars though. Multitools are now being sold at a discount!
  - balance: Prybars can no longer be made in the Rapid Construction Fabricator, Large
      Crowbars now instead take their place, removing the heavy taxes on the RCF and
      making it no longer restricted.

      Dead Mice, Potted Plants, Corgi Meat, Action Figures, Paper Bins, Crayons.'
