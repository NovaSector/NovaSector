      a vacuum, but at least it works on simple mobs now.
  - bugfix: Everyone can now hear a changeling shriek, unless they're already deafened
      or in a vacuum.

      instead of 75% of it.

      it to not overlengthen lobby time. IDK you decide.

      slimes, xenomorphs, revenants and so on, do report any missing case! Logically,
      its incompatible with telepath.
  - qol: The telepathic communication power granted by the quirk or the genetic power
      is only anonymous if THE CASTER has the mutation, not the target, no longer
      feel the need to make it clear who you are with each message if you got the
      quirk only, if you want to be anonymous, bother your local geneticist.

      more clear and less cluttering for the caster of the quirk. Its also now multiline,
      like with subtler.

      (2 points), as its effectively a long range whisper with no way to intercept

      armor, or while carrying objects. However, by wearing martial arts (or carp)
      themed outfits, you can improve your defenses instead, allowing you to not just
      dodge bullets, but also incoming melee attacks.
  - balance: Some objects are exempt, like staff weapons (such as mops or the monk's
      staff), short blades (like knives and shortswords), club-like (baseball bats
      and toolboxes), or thematic (like extendo hands and carp plushies)
  - balance: You can also get these improvements by being a literal carp or being
      a carp person.
