  - balance: Street boxing's knockdowns on critical hits are much shorter now, and
      deals less stamina damage, because crits tend to chain together.
  - balance: Equipping knuckle dusters now gives you a melee attack's worth of click
      delay until your next action. If you're using dusters, commit to using knuckle
      dusters.
  Stalkeros:
  - bugfix: Upside-down pierogi-ravioli are now actually visible.
  dee-dubya:
  - rscadd: 'Adds four new plushies to the loadout: Squishy Yellow Rock, Securifox,
