  - bugfix: Fix runtime when simple mobs are exposed to reagents
  - code_imp: Optimize Nyctophobia quirk to not process while certain traits present
  - rscadd: Add irradiation to radioactive reagents uranium, radium, and polonium.
  - balance: Radioactive reagents uranium, radium, and polonium now cause irradiate
      effects when they come into contact with mobs or objects. This can be via several
      means, ingestion, touch, or vapors. The more radioactive the reagent, the more
      likely it is to irradiate. Polonium is the most radioactive with a x3 multiplier,
      radium is next with a x2 multiplier, and uranium is the weakest with just a
      x1 multiplier.
  - balance: Polonium no longer guarantees instant irradiation when the reagent is
      inside a mob.
  - bugfix: Fix deprecated mob robot path from basketball stadium map
  - code_imp: Convert weather duration to use time defines
