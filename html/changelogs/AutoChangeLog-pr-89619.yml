changes:
  - balance: "Mech PKA low-pressure damage has been reduced to 50, from 80. Increased the attack cooldown to match the standard PKA."
  - balance: "Mech PKA AOE blast does not mine turfs, and only does 30% of the main projectiles damage to mining mobs in the AOE effect."
  - bugfix: "The mech PKA AOE blast visual effect now properly appears when hitting a mob directly."
  - code_imp: "MOB_MINING and MOB_CRUSTACEAN are now defined biotypes."
  - code_imp: "Audits some mining mob biotypes to make more sense based on what kind of creature they are and to include MOB_MINING in their defines."
