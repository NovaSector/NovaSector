  - bugfix: "Using a xenobio console and ctrl-clicking on a tile with dead monkeys on it without a connected monkey recycler no longer runtimes."
  - bugfix: "Destroying a monkey recycler that was once linked to a xenobio console but no longer is no longer disconnects the currently linked monkey recycler from those xenobio consoles."
  - bugfix: "Multiple monkey recyclers mapped into the same xenobiology area no longer enter a weird state of half-connection with the mapped in xenobio consoles."
  - qol: "Adds screentips to the xenobio console's item interactions."
