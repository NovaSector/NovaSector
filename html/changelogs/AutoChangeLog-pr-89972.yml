  - balance: "Flechette has been reworked into an AP pellet round that embeds and wounds, but has less actual damage to buckshot. You can print it once Exotic Ammunition has been researched. Also available to Nuclear Operatives."
  - rscadd: "Donk Co. 'Donk Spike' flechette rounds. No longer offered by Donk Co. It can sometimes shows up in trashbins and dumpsters. And operatives can buy it in bulk if they really feel like it."
