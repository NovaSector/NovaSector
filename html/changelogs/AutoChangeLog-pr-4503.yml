changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new surgery for Synthetic Humanoids called \"Restart Neural Network (Revival)\"."
  - rscadd: "Added Neuroware Chips, usable on synthetic humanoids. Can be obtained via loadout, robotics wardrobe, Deluxe Silicate Selections vendor, cargo goodies, and Donk/DeForest cargo imports."
  - rscadd: "Added Cybernetic Repair Paste which repairs robotic organs via organ manipulation surgery. Obtained via robotics wardrobe, Nanomed Plus, and DeForest cargo import."
  - balance: "Disabled the effects of the Twitch reagent on synthetic humanoids."
  - code_imp: "Renamed the Synthetic Bio-Reactor to Synthetic Fuel Cell to more accurately reflect its functions."
  - refactor: "Enabled mob reagents to process depending on liver type, instead of depending on the mob's species. Reagent effects are still limited to specific body types, bio types, and organ types."
  - qol: "Changed most Synthetic Humanoid surgeries, such as revival, to be more compatible with organic limbs."
  - qol: "Renamed the surgery \"Posibrain Reboot (Revival)\" to \"Chassis Restoration (Repair + Revival)\""
  - qol: "CPR is now possible via chest compressions, without requiring lungs. Rescue breaths will only slightly increase CPR efficacy."

  - qol: "Added SynapTuner Pro neuroware for synthetic humanoid users of the Narcolepsy quirk."
  - qol: "Enabled Succubus Milk and Incubus Draft to process in synthetic humanoids."
  - qol: "Allowed Enriched Liquid Electricity to function as fuel for synth species, which allows them to consume High Power Energy Bars and other similar foods."
  - qol: "Disabled digestion of fuel, CO2, and stable plasma for synths who lack the default synthetic fuel cell stomach."
  - qol: "Enabled digestion of consumables into nutriment for synths who have both a normal/cybernetic stomach and liver."
  - qol: "Updated the Brain Degeneration quirk medical flavortext to match each unique synthetic brain type."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug that was causing humanized monkeys to retain their AI controller after the AI Uplink Brain is inserted."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug that was preventing Liquid Solder from healing synthetic brain damage."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug that was causing Crocin/Hexacrocin to bypass auto-emote preferences."
  - bugfix: "Re-added the Synthetic Charging Implant, or power cord implant, to the science techweb."
  - bugfix: "Fixed instances of non-synthesizable reagents occurring in bees, such as neuroware."
