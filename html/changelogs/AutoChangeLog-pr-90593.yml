changes:
  - bugfix: "fixes a lot of instances of gibs, bodyparts/organs, and blood decals not getting the right forensics data attached to them"
  - refactor: "blood types are now datums, in support of a more robust blood system"
  - image: "all blood decals and overlays have been greyscaled, so ethereals will have green blood now for instance. fundamentally evil quirk havers get black blood"
  - admin: "new smite type, 'Clownify blood'. It pretty much does what you might expect."
