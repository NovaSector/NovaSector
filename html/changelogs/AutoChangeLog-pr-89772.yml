changes:
  - rscadd: "New Medical bounty! Scan crewmates who have been healed or currently have a clean bill of health, and ship the medical report to prove that you're not accidently letting them die on your watch. Most of the time."
  - balance: "Assistant bounties for toolboxes now only require 1, but the toolbox must be fully stocked like standard mechanical toolboxes."
  - balance: "Potted plant bounties no longer accept plastic plants. They only require 3 plants now, however."
  - balance: "The action figure bounty now only requires toys instead."
  - rscdel: "Removed the pens bounty."
  - balance: "The robotics mech bounty now requires a diagnostic scan of a newly completed mech as opposed to sending the whole mech itself. Diagnostic scans can now be generated by riding in a mech and completing the action from the UI menu. Mech bounties are worth about half as much."
  - rscadd: "Mechs can be sold on the cargo shuttle for the remaining half of the value from previous mech bounties."
  - bugfix: "You can now no longer roll duplicates of the same bounties when generating a new bounty from the civilian bounty console."
