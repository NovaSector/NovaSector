changes:
  - balance: "Removes Mining ID's and Mining Headset Keys from the Conscript Kit. Makes the kit requires no access so you can be a yanky miner as you always dreamed! Replaces the Explorer suit with a Seva suit, better fitted for civilians trying to be a miner than real monster hunter miners."
  - rscadd: "Added a Mining Access kit, available only to NT cargo orders, which requires QM access as the mining kit once did. It includes a mining ID and mining headset keys."
